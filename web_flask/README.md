## Airbnb Clone - Flask Web Application

Flask is a powerful yet beginner-friendly Python framework that makes building web applications a breeze. With Flask, you can define routes that map URLs to functions that handle requests. These functions can return content, process user input, or interact with databases. To get started, create a simple Flask app with a route and a view function to display some text. Run the app using `python app.py`
